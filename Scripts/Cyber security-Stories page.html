<h3 align="center"><u> NHS Ransomware Attack</u> </h3>
<p>On Friday 12 May 2017, a computer virus known as WannaCry was released worldwide. This encrypts the data on infected computers and demands a ransom payment for users to get access back. This attack hit the NHS and was the largest cyber attack to hit them. Amyas Morse, who is head of the National Audit Office said that </p>

<p><b>“It was a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice.”</b> </p>
<p>The department was warned of the risks of cyber attacks a year before WannaCry hit, however they didn’t respond with a report until July 2017. They had no formal mechanism in place to see whether local NHS trusts had followed their advice and guidance, and updated the software on all their computer systems. The attack disrupted at least 34% of trusts in England, although they couldn’t tell exactly how much was disrupted. Initially, on 12 May, NHS England identified 45 NHS organisations including 37 trusts that had been affected by the ransomware attack. Which came to a total of at least 81 out of the 236 trusts across England were affected. A further 603 primary care and other NHS organisations were infected by WannaCry, including 595 GP practices. NHS digital says that it believes no patient data were compromised or stolen. </p>
<p>Thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled, and in 5 areas patients had to travel further to accident and emergency departments. Between 12 and 18 May, NHS England collected some information on cancelled appointments to manage the incident, but it didn’t include all types of appointment. They identified 6,912 appointments had been cancelled, and over 19,000 appointments would have been cancelled in total. NHS England and the National Crime Agency said that no NHS organisations had paid the ransom, but doesn’t know how much the attack cost the NHS in terms of loss of service. The cost included cancelled appointments, additional IT support, or the cost of restoring data and systems affected by the attack. Staff also worked overtime including over the weekend to resolve the problems adding a further cost. </p>

<p>This cyber attack could have easily caused more disruption had it not been for a cyber researcher, who stopped it by activating a ‘kill switch’, so it stopped locking devices. Most trusts infected were located in the North NHS region and the Midlands & East NHS region. This is because they were hit early on the 12 May before the ‘kill switch’ was activated. The NHS has accepted that they have lessons to learn from this and need to take action. Infected organisations had unpatched, or unsupported Windows operating systems, so were susceptible to the ransomware. If they had taken action to manage their firewalls facing the internet, it would have guarded the organisation against the infection. They have now taken essential action to secure their local firewalls. </p>
