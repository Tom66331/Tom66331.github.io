<h2 align="center"> Information </h2>
<p>Cyber security uses technologies, processes and controls that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber attacks. The risk of cyber attacks can be reduced by using effective cyber security to protect organisations and individuals from unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies. </p>
<img src="https://www.actiontec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Cyber-Security-1080x675-1024x640.jpeg" height="300" width="500" align="right">
<p>Cyber attacks can disrupt and can cause major financial and reputational damage to even the most resilient of organisation. This can lead to customer’s personal details being exposed or confidential information getting into the wrong hands. Large organisations are always aware of the threat of them being subject to a cyber attack. However many small businesses aren’t aware that they can be targeted which causes them obvious problems. In addition large organisations have the means to recover from these cyber attacks, whereas some smaller businesses may not be able to survive them. This means that they will be forced to go out of business. </p>

<h3> Types of Cyber Security</h3>
<ul type="disc"> 
<li><b>Critical infrastructure</b>- This is the cyber-physical systems that society relies on, which includes traffic lights, electricity grid and hospitals. If any of these are connected to the internet, they can be targeted by hackers. The solution for this is to perform due diligence to understand the vulnerabilities and protect against them. </li>
<img src="https://www.netrounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/network-opt.jpg" height="300" width="500" align="right">
<li><b>Network security</b>- Guards against unauthorised intrusion ensuring that the network security often requires trade-offs. An example of this is that extra logins can be put in, but will slow down productivity. The tools used to detect the threats generate a lot of data, so alerts are often missed. Therefore people are now using machine learning to spot abnormal traffic and alert the person in real time. </li>
<li><b>Cloud security</b>- This creates new security challenges, which is shown by almost weekly data breaches from poorly configured cloud instances. </li>
<img src="https://c3metrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/social-media-mobile-apps-ss-1920.jpg" height="300" width="500" align="right">
<li><b>Application security</b>- This is especially web application security and has become the weakest technical point of attack. It begins with secure coding practices and should be augmented by fuzzing and penetration testing. </li>
<li><b>Internet of things security</b>- Refers to a wide variety of critical and non-critical cyber physical systems such as appliances, sensors, printers and security cameras. The devices frequently ship in an insecure state and offer little to no security patching. This poses threats to not only their users but to others on the internet, as these are often part of a botnet. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3> Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
<ul type="disc"> 
<li><b>Attacks on confidentiality</b>- Stealing or copying a targets personal information is how many cyber-attacks begin, including criminal attacks like credit card fraud, identity theft or stealing bitcoin wallets. Countries use spies to make confidentiality attacks a major portion of their work, seeking to acquire confidential information for political, military or economic gain. </li>
<img src="http://verastic.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Credit-Card-Fraud.jpg" height="300" width="500" align="right">
<li><b>Attacks on integrity</b>- These seek to corrupt, damage or destroy information or systems, and the people who rely on them. Integrity attacks can be subtle with a typo here, bit fiddled there, or a slash and burn campaign of sabotage against a target. An attack like this can be done by just script kiddies to nation-state attackers. </li>
<li><b>Attacks on availability</b>- Ransomware is used to lock your computer and usually means you have to pay to get it back. It encrypts a targets data and when you pay they will decrypt it. This is usually in the form of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which floods the network with requests making it unavailable. </li>
<li><b>Social engineering</b>- Attackers aren’t going to hack a computer when they can hack a computer instead. The end user gets into running a Trojan horse program, even from websites that they trust. </li>
<li><b>Phishing attacks</b>- Attackers use this to steal someone’s password by getting them to reveal it. The best way of avoiding this is to not send passwords in an email or message. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Cyber Security Rules to Follow </h4>
<p>Here are some rules that you should follow because they could reduce the risk massively of you being subject to a cyber attack: </p>
<ol type="numbers">
<li>Avoid clicking links in emails and log on the site directly instead.</li>
<li>Avoid opening any attachment from an unknown sender or a sender that doesn’t need to send you attachments. </li>
<img src="https://thechrisbertsch.com/images/phishing03_web.png" height="300" width="500" align="right">
<li>Turn off you email setting that allows the attachments to be downloaded automatically. </li>
<li>Avoid sharing personal information on your phone or electronically unless you are certain that the person requesting it is genuine and has a legitimate need for the information. </li>
<li>Choose complex passwords and don’t share them with anyone. </li>
<li>Update the software on your device regularly, this could be browsers, operating systems and anti-virus software. </li>
<li>Always verify information requests with the person who is requesting them directly. </li>
<li>Be careful with URLs because criminals can set them up so that they look like the genuine URL, however they just have to make a slight change. </li>
<li>Trust your gut, if you think that the email is fake just delete it, anyone who really wants to contact you can use other means such as your phone.</li>
</ol>
