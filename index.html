<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>Here at the Cyber Security Company, we believe that it is really important that everyone is made aware of dangers that are out there interms of cyber security. In our website we will try and tell you everything you need to know about cyber security to lower the chances of you or your company getting caught out by these attacks. </p>  
<p>With techonology rapidly developing, cyber security is becoming more and more important. This means that it's essentially important that people are more than aware of the risks attached to this. This is because people are finding new things out about what they can use the technology for and not always for the right reasons. Every technological device connected to the internet is in danger of being attacked even with the correct security software on it. This is because the software isn't always as up to date as the attackers are, so they can still find ways through it. Cyber security uses technologies, processes and controls that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber attacks. The risk of cyber attacks can be reduced by using effective cyber security to protect organisations and individuals from unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks and technologies. </p>
<p>In this website will be a wide range of information about cyber security including the types, risks and solutions. </p>
